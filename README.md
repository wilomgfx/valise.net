# valise.net
Projet session d'Échange inter app

Valise.net is a Trip planner based on a REST ASP.NET Web API in c# and a web client built on angular1.
Features custom trip routes, location of interests and suggested visits on your trip. All shown as custom Pin points on a Google map.

This was the final project of my inter-application communication course at college.
